## Reinforcement learning (RL)
RL starts finding its way into more application fields and more companies (Amazon, Ericsson, Adobe, etc.). For example, deep RL has already outperformed supervised learning and rule-based models to personalize product recommendations.

## Federated Learning (FL)
FL enables model training on decentralised data that are distributed over millions of mobile devices. The goal is to provide highly personalized models, while reducing the costs and risks related to sensitive data handling.
Google already uses FL at scale to enable predictive input capabilities in the Android keyboard (Gboard), on-device search for Pixel phones, etc.

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
There is a growing adoption of GANs for an automated language generation.

* Models: SeqGAN, LeakGAN, MaskGAN:
* Capturing nuances and semantics of natural languages (especially, for longer sentences) is still an open issue.

## Data pre-processing

"AI starts with good data". Some tasks of data cleaning and enrichment can be automated using machine learning.

## Building and deploying AI applications at scale
Many talks were dedicated to building and deploying scalable AI pipelines.
