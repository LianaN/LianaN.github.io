<p>Hey! I'm a Data Scientist at Microsoft based in Barcelona. I enjoy all facets of data-driven projects, starting from the data analytics and ending with building intelligent data-driven applications.</p>

<p>Throughout my professional career, I have been involved in numerous projects that created a bridge between research and industry. The projects that foster human values have always inspired me at most.</p>
